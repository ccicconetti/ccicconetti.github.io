*Edge computing* is a [buzzword](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=buzz%20words) widely used in the telecommunications, networking, and cloud computing scientific communities, as well as in the telco industry and some related vertical markets.
It has different meaning depending on the context (and it has absolutely no meaning in many contexts).

In general terms, the _edge_ is referred to the border between:

1. the domain where the users operate through their devices, and
2. the outside world, which often but not necessarily connects to the Internet.
