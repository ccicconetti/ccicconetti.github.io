I have a PhD in Information Engineering from the University of Pisa (2007), where I also received my Laurea degree in Computer Science Engineering.
I have been working in [INTECS](http://www.intecs.it/eng) from 2009 to 2013 as an R&D Manager and a Business Unit leader within the Telecommunications division, where I also acted as the official contact for ETSI and Net!Works.
From 2014 to 2018 I have been a software engineer at [MBI](http://mbigroup.it/en/index) working on the design, development, validation, and operation of Software Defined Radio powered satellite communication platforms.
I am now a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/).
I have been the project manager of projects [CROWD](http://www.ict-crowd.eu/) (FP7 - 4.5 MEUR) and SAT4NET (ESA - 280 kEUR), the team leader for Intecs in [SANDRA](http://sandra.aero/) (FP7), and the chief promoter of FP7 projects BETaaS and ICSI.
In the past I have been involved in MOTO (FP7), EuQoS (FP6), WINNER+ (Celtic), and other national R&D projects (QuaSAR, NADIR, IPERMOB).
I was in the editorial board of [Computer Networks](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-networks/) and has served as a member of the organization committee of several international conferences (WoWMoM, IoT-SoS, ISCC, WiOpt, European Wireless, SIMUTools, Valuetools, QoSim, NSTools).
I co-authored 50+ papers published in international journals, peer-reviewed conference proceedings and book chapters, and two international patents.
