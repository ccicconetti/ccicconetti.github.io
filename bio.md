I have a PhD in Information Engineering from the University of Pisa (2007), where I also received my Laurea degree in Computer Science Engineering.
I have been working in [Intecs](http://www.en.intecs.it/) from 2009 to 2013 as an R&D Manager and a Business Unit leader within the Telecommunications division, where I also acted as the official contact for ETSI and Net!Works.
From 2014 to 2018 I have been a software engineer at [MBI](http://mbigroup.it/en/index) working on the design, development, validation, and operation of Software Defined Radio powered satellite communication platforms.
I am now a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/).
I have been the project manager of projects FP7 CROWD and ESA SAT4NET, the team leader for Intecs in FP7 SANDRA, and the chief promoter of FP7 projects BETaaS and ICSI.
In the past I have been involved in FP7 MOTO, FP6 EuQoS, Celtic WINNER+, and other national R&D projects (QuaSAR, NADIR, IPERMOB).
In 2021 I have been the recipient, with Prof. Enzo Mingozzi, of a research grant awarded by the Networking Team at [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/blog/2021/08/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2021-networking-request-for-proposals-in-internet-and-web-services/).
I was in the editorial board of [Computer Networks](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-networks/) and has served as a member of the organization committee of several international conferences (WoWMoM, IoT-SoS, ISCC, WiOpt, European Wireless, SIMUTools, Valuetools, QoSim, NSTools).
I co-authored 60+ papers published in international journals, peer-reviewed conference proceedings and book chapters, and two international patents.
I have an [Erd√∂s Number 3](http://www.oakland.edu/enp/).
