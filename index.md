Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitout Internet](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/), with ORCID iD [0000-0003-4503-4223](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4503-4223).

**Short experience list**: MAC protocols and scheduling in wireless systems (WLAN, 802.16, LTE & beyond); performance evaluation via simulation; C++ programming; satellite communication; SDR; SDN; edge computing.

**Current interest**: network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. application of serverless paradigm to edge computing.
