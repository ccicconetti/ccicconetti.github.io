Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/en/), see [short bio](bio.md).

### Current interests

- Network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. **serverless computing** in edge networks.
- **Quantum networking**, esp. secure data transmission over classical networks with side quantum channel, as well as protocols and algorithms for the realisation of distributed quantum computing through the Quantum Internet of the future.

### Highlights

- Working on serverless for pervasive systems? Submit your paper to [\*LESS](https://starless.iit.cnr.it/) by Nov 14, 2021!
