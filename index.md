Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/).

**Short experience list**: MAC protocols and scheduling in wireless systems (WLAN, 802.16, LTE & beyond); performance evaluation via simulation; C++ programming; satellite communication; SDR; SDN; edge computing.

**Current interest**: network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. application of serverless paradigm to edge computing.

### Highlights

- "Serverless Edge Computing: Vision and Challenges" won **best paper** award at _AusPDC 2021_ [check it out!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437378.3444367)
- Submission to [IEEE WoWMoM'21](http://wowmom2021.iit.cnr.it/), to be hosted in Pisa, Italy in June 7-11, 2021 is now closed, but please consider submitting your contribution to one of the [6 co-located workshops](http://wowmom2021.iit.cnr.it/workshops.html) and, only for PhD students, sending a 2-page abstract of your research activity to the [PhD Forum](http://wowmom2021.iit.cnr.it/workshops.html): deadline for both is **March 1st 2021**
