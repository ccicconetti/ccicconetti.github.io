Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/en/), see [short bio](bio.md).

### Current interests

- Network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. **serverless computing** in edge networks.
- **Quantum networking**, esp. secure data transmission over classical networks with side quantum channel, as well as protocols and algorithms for the realisation of distributed quantum computing through the Quantum Internet of the future (check [_Teaching the qubits to fly_](https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en128/special/teaching-the-qubits-to-fly) on ERCIM NEWS 128)

### Highlights

- Two papers published in the Sept. 2022 issue of **IEEE Computer**:
  - [In-Network Computing With Function as a Service at the Edge](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9869606)
  - [Stateful Function as a Service at the Edge](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9869564)
