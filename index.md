Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/).

**Short experience list**: MAC protocols and scheduling in wireless systems (WLAN, 802.16, LTE & beyond); performance evaluation via simulation; C++ programming; satellite communication; SDR; SDN; edge computing.

**Current interests**: 1) network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. application of serverless paradigm to edge computing; 2) quantum networking, esp. secure data transmission over classical networks with side quantum channel, as well as protocols and algorithms for the realisation of distributed quantum computing through the Quantum Internet of the future.
