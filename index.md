Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/en/), see [short bio](bio.md).

### Current interests

- Network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. **serverless computing** in edge networks.
- **Quantum networking**, esp. secure data transmission over classical networks with side quantum channel, as well as protocols and algorithms for the realisation of distributed quantum computing through the Quantum Internet of the future (check [_Teaching the qubits to fly_](https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en128/special/teaching-the-qubits-to-fly) on ERCIM NEWS 128)

### Highlights

- [Qkd@Edge: Online Admission Control of Edge Applications with QKD-secured Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02015) accepted for oral presentation at [IEEE SMARTCOMP 2023](https://smartcomp.isis.vanderbilt.edu/), to be held in Nashville, Tennessee in June 26-29, where I will also give a tutorial on _From quantum computing to quantum networks_. Please [register to the conference](https://smartcomp.isis.vanderbilt.edu/index.html#registration) and join us!
- [Balancing local vs. remote state allocation for micro-services in the cloud-edge continuum](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2023.101808) published on **Pervasive and Mobile Computing**
- [Service differentiation and fair sharing in distributed quantum computing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2023.101758) published on **Pervasive and Mobile Computing**
- [Quality of Service in Quantum Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964002) published in the Sep-Oct 2022 issue of **IEEE Network**
