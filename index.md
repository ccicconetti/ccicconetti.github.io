Hello, I'm a Researcher in the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) group of [IIT-CNR](http://www.iit.cnr.it/en/), see [short bio](bio.md).

### Current interests

- Network softwarisation in beyond 5G systems, esp. **serverless computing** in edge networks.
- **Quantum networking**, esp. secure data transmission over classical networks with side quantum channel, as well as protocols and algorithms for the realisation of distributed quantum computing through the Quantum Internet of the future (check [_Teaching the qubits to fly_](https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en128/special/teaching-the-qubits-to-fly) on ERCIM NEWS 128)

### Highlights

- Submit your paper by **Apr 30, 2023** (firm) to the Feature Topic on _Serverless Mobile Computing: From Theory to Practice_ of the IEEE Communications Magazine, info [here]( https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine/cfp/serverless-mobile-computing-theory-practice)
- [Service differentiation and fair sharing in distributed quantum computing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2023.101758) published on **Pervasive and Mobile Computing**
- [Quality of Service in Quantum Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964002) published in the Sep-Oct 2022 issue of **IEEE Network**
