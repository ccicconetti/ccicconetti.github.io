### Summary

The development of quantum technology has accelerated significantly in the recent past due to worldwide private and public investments.
In parallel, a new need has emerged: interconnecting quantum systems in a such a way that they can share entanglement of their qubits, e.g., for deployment of distributed quantum computing applications across geographical distance.
Unfortunately, quantum communications are rather fragile, thus it is not possible today for two quantum computers a few tens of km apart to interact.
One way to overcome this limitation is to introduce _quantum repeaters_ to extend the communication range.
In our paper we push this concept even further and consider a _network_ of quantum repeaters (globally, we can call it the Quantum Internet).

Like in the traditional Internet, _routing_ is an important aspect of the Quantum Internet, even though the constraints and challenges are very different: since qubits cannot be copied (due to the [no-cloning theorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem)), the entanglement
