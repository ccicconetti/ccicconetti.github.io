abstract = {The EDGELESS project is set to efficiently operate serverless computing in extremely diverse computing environments, from resource-constrained edge devices to highly-virtualized cloud platforms. Automatic deployment and reconfiguration will leverage AI/ML techniques, resulting in a flexible horizontally-scalable computation solution able to fully use heterogeneous edge resources while preserving vertical integration with the cloud and the benefits of serverless and its companion programming model, i.e., Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). The system under design will be environmentally sustainable, as it will dynamically concentrate resources physically (e.g., by temporarily switching off far-edge devices) or logically (e.g., by dispatching tasks towards a specific set of nodes) at the expense of performance-tolerant applications.},
