abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) holds the promise of a secure exchange of cryptographic material between applications that have access to the same network of QKD nodes, interconnected through fiber optic or satellite links. Worldwide several such networks are being deployed at a metropolitan level, where edge computing is already offered by the telco operators to customers as a viable alternative to both cloud and on-premise hosting of computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the implications of enabling QKD for edge-native applications from a practical perspective of resource allocation in the QKD network and the edge infrastructure. Specifically, we consider the dichotomy between aggregating all the applications on the same sourceâ€“destination path vs. adopting a more flexible micro-flow approach, inspired from Software Defined Networking (SDN) concepts. Our simulation results show that there is a fundamental trade-off between the efficient use of resources and the signaling overhead, which we managed to diminish with the use of suitable hybrid solutions.}
