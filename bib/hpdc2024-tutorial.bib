abstract = {Quantum computing addresses the construction and operation of quantum computers to solve more efficiently instances of specific problems that are difficult to tackle with classical computers. Even if we are currently in the so-called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ), steady signs of progress are being made towards the realization of a fast and reliable quantum computer, materializing the basic building blocks of quantum circuits, i.e., quantum bits and gates. On the other hand, quantum communications cover the transmission of quantum states across distances. Recent advances in this context have led to the novel research area of quantum networking, which is set to define the programming interfaces and protocols for the practical operation of quantum communication and computing infrastructures. The tutorial has the objective of raising awareness about these emerging topics, i.e., quantum computing and quantum networking, in the research community by i) introducing briefly the latest technologies developed in each, then ii) providing hands-on examples of how to use them for simple use cases, and iii) finally sketching the more promising open research challenges.},
