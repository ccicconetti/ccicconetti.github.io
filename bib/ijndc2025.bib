	abstract = {As the field of the quantum internet advances, a comprehensive guide to navigate its complexities has become increasingly crucial. While quantum computing shares foundational principles with the quantum internet, distinguishing between the two is essential for further development and deeper understanding. This work systematically introduces the quantum internet by discussing its importance, core components, operational mechanisms, anticipated timeline for viability, key contributors, major challenges, and future directions. Additionally, it presents the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics that underpin the technology, offering a clear and targeted overview intended for researchers and industry professionals and laying the groundwork for future innovations and research in the field.},
