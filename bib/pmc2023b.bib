abstract = {In the world of cloud technologies, serverless computing has now settled as a stable and promising resident. This gives a cloud provider the flexibility to provide its users with both Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), i.e., the back-end application runs in a dedicated container, or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), i.e., the back-end logic is offered as elementary functions that are invoked by the client applications. In parallel, edge computing has attracted a significant interest, due its enticing promises of reducing the outbound traffic of telco operators, while at the same time cutting down the user latency. As a result, in the near future, PaaS and FaaS containers are going to cohabit in a versatile computation infrastructure spanning from the far edge up to the cloud. In this paper we propose a mathematical formulation of a resource allocation problem that optimizes the assignment of both types of containers and can be solved efficiently by an edge orchestrator. We evaluate the proposed solution via extensive simulation experiments, which show that our approach, which takes into account the characteristics of PaaS vs.Â FaaS, provides significant performance benefits compared to less sophisticated strategies, despite its relatively low run-time complexity.}
